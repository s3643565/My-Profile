<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an international student studying Bachelor of Business Information Systems here at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.
 Currently, I am in my final year final semester. My nationality is Bangladeshi, my mother tongue is Bangla and English is my second language. 
 Before starting my Bachelorâ€™s, I gave my IGCSE and IAL in Bangladesh under British Council. 
 At my leisure times, I usually go beach hopping as I love to sit in front of the ocean and listen to some chilled music all by myself.
 Other than that, I love playing football and playing PC games like Call of Duty </p>
